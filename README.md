# Laravel dockerized with official Google App Engine flexible php environment + swoole (ready for production).

You can build this image for production on GAE flexible using auto managed redis (Memory Store service) and database (SQL service) by Google Cloud Plataform building from Dockerfile, or run all locally using the docker-compose file.

## Tips to customization

With this container you can edit `php.ini`, `nginx.conf`, `fastcgi_params`, `gzip_params`, `supervisord.conf` and `php-fpm.conf` files, just add them to the root folder and make your changes, they will be used on the next `docker-compose up --build` or on your next deploy to GAE using `gcloud app deploy`. All the original files related can be found [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/php-docker/tree/master/php-base).

The `supervisord.conf` file is ready to run the swoole server and horizon at the start, and the `php artisan schedule:run` command each minute.

## Example of repo using this container

https://github.com/ibrunotome/laravel-api-templates

The above repo use the swooletw/laravel-swoole package. Just choose one of the structures (default delivered by Laravel, or a structure inspired in DDD), and run `docker-compose up`. It's up and running :)

## Swoole

I did some edits in Dockerfile, extending the official image (gcr.io/google-appengine/php72:latest) to enable swoole extension to get better performance (almost 400 reqs/sec on a real laravel world application with database/redis, etc) and 3000 reqs/sec with nginx micro cache. If you wanna use swoole with laravel, you can install one of the following packages: 

#### swooletw/laravel-swoole

This package offers an easy plug and play of swoole into your Laravel application.

https://github.com/swooletw/laravel-swoole 

After that, you have published the package configs and set the port on `swoole_http.php` file to match with the port that you are listening on your upstream of `nginx.conf` file (the current port is `9000`), and set start the server on `supervisord.conf`, you just need to start your server and the nginx acts as a reverse proxy to your swoole server.

#### hhxsv5/laravel-s

If you want to put your hands in many of the truly skills of swoole (goroutines, asyncronous tasks/events, millisecond cron jobs), you can install the following package.

## FPM

If you wanna use php-fpm instead of swoole extension (seriously, WHY?), so remove swoole extension from `php.ini` and the swoole program from `supervisord.conf`, uncomment the php-fpm program of `supervisord.conf` file and remove the related lines of swoole from `Dockerfile`.

## F.A.Q

- **Can I use this image with pure php or other frameworks instead of Laravel?** *Sure*

## How to use it locally

- You need to have docker and docker-compose installed.
- Put the files of this repo in the root of your laravel project.
- Configure your .env to point to the docker-compose services (like `pgsql` for db host, or `redis-cache` for redis host)
- Run ```docker-compose run app bash -c "composer update"```
- Run ```docker-compose run app bash -c "php artisan migrate:fresh --seed"```
- Run ```docker-compose up -d```
- That's all folks :) Now you have locally exactly the same image that you run on GAE flexible php environment.
- Of course, remember to bind your .env variables and hosts with your docker-compose.yml file.

## How to deploy it to Google App Engine (GAE)

Just put all the files of this repo on the root of your laravel project, then change your [app.yaml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/php/configuring-your-app-with-app-yaml) section: `runtime: php` to `runtime: custom`, and deploy your application with `gcloud app deploy` command. That's it ðŸŽ‰. You can learn more about GAE here: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/

## Deploy to GAE using a CI/CD pipeline

Google has an amazing CI tool called [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/), it can easy run containers to test/deploy your code  across multiple environments such as GAE, VMs, serverless, Kubernetes, or Firebase. Here an example of a Pipeline for laravel deploy using Cloud Build:

```yaml
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gsutil'
  args: ['cp', '.env.testing', '.env']
- name: 'docker/compose:1.23.1'
  args: ['run', 'app', 'composer', 'install', '--optimize-autoloader', '--no-interaction', '--no-ansi', '--no-progress', '--no-scripts', '--prefer-dist']
- name: 'docker/compose:1.23.1'
  args: ['run', 'app', 'vendor/bin/phpunit', '--no-coverage']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
  args: ['app', 'deploy', '--no-promote']
timeout: '1800s'
```
